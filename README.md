🎓 PhD Candidate in Computational Materials Science  
🧪 Atomistic simulations of amorphous silica and confined water  

I study the nanostructuration of silica induced by molecular water trapped in nanoscale pores within a glass matrix. Using molecular dynamics (LAMMPS) and Python-based structural analysis, I investigate densification, pore evolution, and network reorganization during thermal treatments.
