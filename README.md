🧪 Silica–Water Interactions | Nanoconfined Fluids | Molecular Dynamics  

I investigate how water interacts with and modifies silica glass, particularly in the context of hydration and nanoconfinement. As water becomes an inherent by-product of emerging low-carbon glass manufacturing processes, understanding its impact on structural, dynamical, and mechanical properties is critical.

Using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations (LAMMPS), I study nanoconfined water trapped in silica pores and its influence across nano- to macroscopic scales. My work explores hydration levels, pore size distributions, and interatomic potential comparisons (ReaxFF, DCRP) to better capture the diversity of water–silica interactions and their effect on glass behavior.
