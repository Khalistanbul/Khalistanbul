## About

I am a doctoral researcher working on the nanostructuration of amorphous silica induced by molecular water confined in nanoscale pores within a glass matrix. My work combines large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis to understand densification, pore evolution, and network reorganization during thermal treatments as well as overall mechanical behavior.

## Research Focus

My research centers on:

- Molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS  
- Silica–water interactions at the nanoscale  
- Thermal quenching and structural relaxation  
- Porosity evolution and confined fluids  
- High-performance computing workflows
- Mechanical response of hydrous glasses

## Methods & Tools

I develop reproducible simulation pipelines and post-processing tools for large atomistic systems:

- LAMMPS (classical MD, custom workflows)  
- Python (NumPy, MDAnalysis, scientific computing)  
- Structural and volumetric analysis methods  
- Linux and HPC cluster environments  
- Version-controlled research with Git
